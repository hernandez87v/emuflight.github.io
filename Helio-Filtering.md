### IMUF?
EmuFlight has taken full advantage of HelioRC releasing all their work as opensource. One big step that was taken was to add the IMUF filter to all flight controllers. The IMUF is a very unique filter that works based off of setpoint weight (stick input). This filter is very very good at handling propwash as well as handling bent props. 

The IMUF is one of the big reasons why EmuFlight is unique! The IMUF does a great job of handling noise without the need of any RPM filtering. This makes whoops and toothpick size quads (which can't natively support rpm filtering) fly extremely well.
