## In-Flux Defaults

Default settings as well as CLI commands have changed from one version to the next. We try to list these under the version Release-Notes. A recommended method to keep track of configurations and changes is:
* Save both a `diff all` and `dump all` from your quads before updating.
* Save a `dump all` containing defaults for each freshly flashed EmuFlight version and save such with "defaults" in the filename.

## Firmware Releases
Releases can be found here: [https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/releases](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/releases) or downloaded from [EmuConfigurator](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuConfigurator/releases). Recommended to always check Release-Notes and other Details on the various versions.
