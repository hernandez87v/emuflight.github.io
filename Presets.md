### PID Tuning Presets
In EmuFlight 0.2.0 and above, we now have Presets provided by numerous community members.

In the PID Tuning tab, select a preset of choice and save. Please note that because no two quadcopters are equal, these presets may or may not be a good match and should be considered as particularly good starting points.

As with all PID Tunes, please be cautious when first arming.  Although `runaway_takeoff_prevention = ON` by default, always err on the side of safety.

* Disclaimer: Defaults and presets should be considered a generic starting point.  Although we feel them to be comfortably safe, please know that tuning your quad is still required, including lowpass filters and possibly notches. Do not flash and "rip", or risk R.I.P.  Members of @EmuTestBandits have been using higher than historic dTerm values; However, please be diligent in testing motor-heat in incremental test-hovers of 10, 20, and 30 or more second intervals.  EmuFlight is provided free as-is without warranty of any kind.
