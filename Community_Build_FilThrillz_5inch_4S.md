Reason behind tune:
I tuned it this way to correlate to my flight style and stick feel. I didn't mess too much with pids and filtering because I've always thought that anything default is as close as you can get to a perfect flight experience out the box. I had my share of spending too much time tuning and not flying. I'd rather be spending more time flying than tuning. And thats my idea behind my tune.

WARNING: End-Users, please be extra cautious for motor-heat due DTerm 55.
