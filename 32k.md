EmuFlight is the last opensource software to continue to support 32k. Because of the feelings that many users have around 32k, it is not on by default. However many of our users prefer 32k, while others seem to prefer 4k. Many of the problems that 32k has seen in the past are solved by better filtering that is found in EmuFlight. If your wondering if 32k is worth it give it a try and come up with your own opinion. Another fun thing to play with is turning the gyro to experimental mode which almost completely removes the built in gyro lowpass filter (this is what FlightOne does).

Skylion Tip: If you want to run full 32k/32k on most flight controllers you will need to overclock to 240mhz on f4 or f7 flight controllers in order to get your cpu% down to a reasonable level. In my experience most people will not notice the difference between 16k/16k and 32k/32k, unless you are pushing your quad to the absolute limit. If you would like to try 32k/16k you'll only have to overclock to 216mhz on f4 and no overclock on f7, 16k/16k on f4 might want to overclock to 192mhz but shouldn't be totally necessary.
