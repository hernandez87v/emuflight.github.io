Please upload fonts to your flight-controllers.

Please note that some flight controllers require battery power to successfully save fonts.

v2 fonts are supported with 0.2.22-RC2, dev-versions â‰¥0.2.35, and 0.3.X using [EmuConfigurator](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuConfigurator/releases) 0.2.12-RC2 or newer.

v1 fonts are mostly fixed in EmuConfigurator 0.2.16 and above with some caveats. Crosshair works.

Feel free to use this Logo to build your own fonts.
