<p>EmuFlight is a very easy to tune software that handles propwash, bent proops, and wind quite well. Its something worth trying for sure!</p>

<h3 id="if-im-flying-betaflightkissflightone-should-i-try-emuflight">If I’m flying Betaflight/KISS/Flightone should I try EmuFlight?</h3>
<p>EmuFlight is very easy to use. Setup is quick and flight performance out of the box is enough to make many pilots convert there whole fleet to EmuFlight. If you want a locked RaceFlight feel with solid propwash and bent prop handling you’ll want to give EmuFlight a try. No need to learn how to setup fancy rpm filters or spend hours fiddling with blackbox logs in order to get a decent tune (you can use blackbox on EmuFlight). Give us a try, worst case you can just flash back to whatever you were using and tell all your friends that EmuFlight is just hype.</p>

<h3 id="who-absolutely-needs-to-flash-emuflight-right-now">Who absolutely needs to flash EmuFlight right now?</h3>
<p>Anyone who is currently flying ButterFlight should upgrade to EmuFlight. ButterFlight is dead and EmuFlight will be where ButterFlight pilots should turn to for the future.</p>

<p>Anyone flying anything larger than a 5inch needs to give EmuFlight a try. Tuning a 7inch or even a 10inch is made much simpler by making the switch to EmuFlight.</p>

<p>Anyone who is flying Helio should turn to EmuFlight. EmuFlight has updated the imuf in Helio boards as well as updated the rest of the flight code enough to make it worth your time.</p>

<p>Anyone who still flies Betaflight 3.5.x should give EmuFlight a try. EmuFlight is fairly similar to Betaflight 3.5.x but with many many worthwhile additions and advanced filtering that makes it definitely worth a try. There is nothing that you would miss from switching over.</p>
