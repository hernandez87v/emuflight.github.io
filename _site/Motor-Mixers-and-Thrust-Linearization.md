## Motor Mixers and  Thrust Linearization

### 0.4.0+
The new mixers and linearizations are independent functions but may be used together to provide a preferred fly-style. Code and ideas from Tyler Corleone and QuickFlash.

### Motor Mixer notes:
- `LEGACY` is the mixer we have always had. (Note: for 100% legacy-mode, `linear_throttle` should be `OFF` and `linear_thrust_high_output` should be `0`; However, pilots are welcome to use both Thrust-Linearization and Throttle-Linearization.)
- `SMOOTH` is a simple variant that applies smoother transitions to avoid mixer-output clipping.
- `2PASS` is a SMOOTH variant that mixes yaw and roll/pitch separately in order to try to guarantee thrust linearity for roll and pitch and motor output linearity (almost RPM linearity) for yaw.
- `mixer_laziness` ON/OFF. When ON, requires Thrust-Linearization values configured (`>0`). Both SMOOTH and 2PASS can use an option called "laziness" that enables a smarter "clipping prevention" strategy, that is called lazy because it adds only the minimum required amount of offset to remain in the [0, 1] for each "motor group" (that is a group of opposite motors that can actually work in conjunction in order to obtain a certain amount of roll/pitch) instead of applying the biggest needed amount. In this way we avoid to add/increase the total thrust when not needed, obtaining a better "throttle authority".


```
# get mixer

mixer_impl = 2PASS
Allowed values: LEGACY, SMOOTH, 2PASS
Default value: LEGACY

mixer_laziness = ON
Allowed values: OFF, ON
Default value: OFF
```

### Thrust Linearization notes:
- Two settings: `linear_thrust_low_output` for low motor output (low RPM) and `linear_thrust_high_output` for high motor output (high RPM). Use this tool to understand what you need to set (65/30 are good starting points for low and high output) https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ofaiocun0b
- Both values need to be != 0 (not zero) for TL being applied.
- `linear_throttle` gives you a linear throttle/thrust feeling. The hovering level will be lower (e.g. what before was 30% now could be 20%). This means that you need to be used to this before you can appreciate its advantages (more room on the upper part of the throttle)
- [TPA](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/wiki/TPA) is automatically disabled when TL is enabled because it already solves high throttle issues.


```
# get linear

linear_thrust_low_output = 65
Allowed range: 0 - 100

linear_thrust_high_output = 30
Allowed range: 0 - 100
Default value: 0

linear_throttle = ON
Allowed values: OFF, ON
Default value: OFF
```
